# **Light & Sound Therapy**

This is a web-based application designed for brainwave entrainment using synchronized light and sound stimulation. It is especially effective when used with AR/XR glasses like RayNeo, which can provide a fully immersive visual field. The goal is to gently guide the user's mind into various states of relaxation, focus, or creativity through the use of flickering light and binaural beats.

## **Features**

* **Visual Stimulation:** A full-screen flicker effect with an adjustable frequency from 1 Hz to 60 Hz.  
* **Auditory Stimulation:** Integrated binaural beats that automatically sync with the chosen light frequency.  
* **Frequency Presets:** Quick-select buttons for common brainwave states (Relaxation, Focus, Cognition, Meditation).  
* **Mind State Colors:** Selectable colors to enhance the mood and experience of the session.  
* **Session Patterns:** Pre-programmed journeys that guide the user through different frequency phases for specific goals, such as:  
  * Ramp Up (for Focus)  
  * Deep Dive (for Meditation)  
  * Sleep Induction  
  * Creative Flow  
  * Calm & Release  
  * Ganzfeld Journey (for mental expansion)  
* **Session Timer:** Adjustable session durations from 5 minutes to 30 minutes, plus a manual stop option for standard sessions.  
* **Immersive Experience:** The app automatically enters full-screen and attempts to lock the orientation to landscape on mobile devices for an uninterrupted session.  
* **Persistent Settings:** The app saves all your selections (frequency, color, duration, pattern, and audio toggle) between sessions for your convenience.

## **How to Use**

**Note for AR/XR Glasses users (e.g., RayNeo):** For the best experience, open this application in the browser on your glasses or connected device to create a fully immersive environment.

1. **Select a Session Pattern:**  
   * Choose **"Standard"** if you want to control the frequency and color manually.  
   * Choose one of the other patterns for a guided session. When a pattern is selected, the manual controls will be disabled.  
2. **Choose Session Duration:** Select how long you want your session to last from the dropdown menu. Note: "Manual Stop" is only available for the "Standard" pattern.  
3. **Enable Binaural Beats:** Click the "Binaural Beats" button to toggle the audio on or off. The button will be highlighted in blue when active. **Headphones or earbuds are required for this feature to work correctly.**  
4. **Start the Session:** Press the **START** button. The session will begin with a "close your eyes" animation.  
5. **Stop the Session:** You can stop the session at any time by pressing any key on your keyboard, tapping the screen, or waiting for the timer to finish.
